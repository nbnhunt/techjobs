This was the final project in LC101. This code is of a website which features search functionality, SQL database connection, and a thorough use of Java classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

The code here was the culmination of months of learning and practice, and I'm very proud of making the deadline with a little time to spare. It made that final class all the sweeter.

This was made with Spring Boot and the MVC design pattern.
